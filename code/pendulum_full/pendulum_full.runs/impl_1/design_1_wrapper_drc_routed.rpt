PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/motor_pwm_0/U0/motor_pwm_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwm_gen_inst/next_counter_reg[11]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/motor_pwm_0/U0/motor_pwm_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwm_gen_inst/next_counter_reg[11]_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/motor_pwm_0/U0/motor_pwm_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwm_gen_inst/next_counter_reg[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
