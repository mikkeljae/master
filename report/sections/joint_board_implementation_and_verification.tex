This section will elaborate on the implementation of the design created in section \ref{sub:analysis}.
Specifically the methods and equipment used is discussed.
In addition, the verification of the finished product is presented in appropriate detail.
This will give the reader an impression of the method used to verify the implementation.
\subsubsection{Mechanics Implementation} % (fold)
\label{ssub:mechanics_implementation}
The joint design created in the previous section was manufactured by the SDU Workshop.
As the more experienced mechanical technicians at the workshop worked through the design they worked with the authors to improve on the design to make it practically possible to construct.
The implemented system is shown in the picture of figure \ref{fig:joint_ass_real}

This procedure is created in an effort to allow for an easier debugging procedure of a newly produced controller board, should a developer require the production of a new board.
A blank version appropriate for printing can be found in appendix \ref{sec:joint_board_verification_procedure}.
\cmark ~is used to indicate the successful verification of a test while \xmark ~is used to indicate the initial failure of a test.
All pins, components and nets are typeset using the \texttt{teletype font} and are referenced to the schematics in appendix \ref{app:joint_board_schem}.

\subsubsection{Joint Board Verification Procedure} % (fold)
\label{ssub:joint_board_verification_methodology}
This procedure is created in an effort to allow for an easier debugging procedure of a newly produced controller board, should a developer require the production of a new board.
A blank version appropriate for printing can be found in appendix \ref{sec:controller_board_verification_procedure}.
It should be noted that the version seen below is not identical to the one found in the appendix.
This is because some of the tests performed below are done to verify that the design is done correctly, rather than ensuring that production has been done correctly.
\cmark is used to indicate the successful verification of a test while \xmark is used to indicate the initial failure of a test.
All pins, components and nets are typeset using the \texttt{teletype font} and are referenced to the schematics in appendix \ref{app:controller_board_schem}.
\paragraph{Verify Voltage Rails:} % (fold)
 \label{par:verify_voltage_rails}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Apply 3.7V to \texttt{VBATT}.
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item[\xmark] Verify that current draw is within reasonable limits ($<$75 mA). Note that the PCB requires a short pulse of approximately 0.89A while booting.
 		\begin{itemize}
 			\item[-] A short circuit seemed to exist on the 5V rail.
 			See next paragraph.
 		\end{itemize}
 		\item[\xmark] Verify 5V and 3.3V voltage rails.
 		\begin{itemize}
 			\item[-] The 3.3V rail functions as intended but the 5V rail is missing.
 			From inspection of the circuit it was discovered that the diode D1 has a fault in the footprint.
 			The six-pin package can be flipped and the centre legs lifted to resolve the issue.
 			During testing the lab supply used to power the board was limited to $\approx$250mA which, due to the required startup current, yielded what looked like a short circuit.
 			Figure \ref{fig:joint_curr_limit} shows the current spike and the resulting failure of the 5V rail to rise.
 			In an attempt to find the offending component the current limit was raised to $\approx$1A.
 			This allowed the 5V rail to properly boot, leading to the discovery of the required startup current.
 			According to the datasheet of the SP6641 \cite{sp6641b} it requires a startup current of $\approx$0.65A. 
 			The resulting current draw and voltage can be seen in figure \ref{fig:joint_no_curr_limit}.

\label{par:verify_attiny84_functionality}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Load the \texttt{ATtiny} with the blink software, available in the associated git repository.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[\xmark] Verify that the on-board LED is blinking
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] The software was loaded successfully occasionally but would often fail.
			This was found to be due to missing pull-up on the \texttt{RESET} pin.
			A pull-up resistor of 3.92k$\Omega$ can be placed on signals \texttt{RESET\_H} and \texttt{5V}.
			The pull-up resistor cannot be placed on the \texttt{ATtiny} since the 74LCX244 and the \texttt{ATtiny} would otherwise both attempt to drive the \texttt{RESET} net.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:pendulum_should_only_x_y}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:verification_of_requirement_enum:pendulum_should_only_x_y}
This requirement states that the pendulum assembly should allow movement only in the X-Y plane. 

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
When the pendulum assembly was mounted on the cart it was found that some movement in the Z plane was possible.
By actuating the cart it was found that it is actually possible for the joints to collide, which is clearly problematic.
As descried the authors only have small knowledge in the world of mechanical engineering and it was decided to omit further work on the problem.
Instead it is proposed that a future developer with more mechanical knowledge should seek to find a solution to the problem 

\subsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:joint_voltage_rails}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:joint_voltage_rails}
This requirement states that 3.3V and 5V rails should be available for the components in the circuit.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
The presence of the two voltage rails are verified in the procedure shown in section \ref{par:verify_voltage_level_shifter_functionality}.
Furthermore the mean value of the two rails were measured over a period of 25ms, yielding 3.27V and 5.07.
Both mean values are within the maximum values.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:rotate_freely_joint}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:verification_of_requirement_enum:rotate_freely_joint}
This requirement specifies that joint should be able to rotate freely about the mounting axis.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
This functionality was verified.


\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:joint_include_nrf}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:verification_of_requirement_enum:joint_include_nrf}
This requirement specifies that the \texttt{nRFM} should be included for communication.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
The \texttt{nRFM} was included in the joint board PCB and wired to the \texttt{ATtiny}.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:interface_rs422_enc}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:verification_of_requirement_enum:interface_rs422_enc}
This requirement specifies that the \texttt{RL2IC} encoders RS-422 interface should be correctly interfaced.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
The RS-422 receiver \texttt{DS26LS32CM} was placed on the joint board PCB to decode the signals from the \texttt{RL2IC} encoder.
In section \ref{par:verify_rs_422_circuitry_functionality} the functionality of the \texttt{DS26LS32CM} is verified. 

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:program_5v_spi}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:verification_of_requirement:enum:program_5v_spi}
This requirement specifies that the design should allow programming of the \texttt{ATtiny} using 5V SPI.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
Programming the \texttt{ATtiny} using 5V SPI was made possible using voltage level shifting.
While developing software for the \texttt{ATtiny} it was revealed that the \texttt{74LCX244} and \texttt{ATtiny} both attempt to drive the \texttt{SCLK} and \texttt{MOSI} nets, resulting in the communication with the \texttt{nRFM} not functioning.
This is a design error and should be fixed in later versions of the design.
A temporary fix was done by soldering a wire to the enable pin of the \texttt{74LCX244} and connecting it to a switch connected to \texttt{GND} and \texttt{5V}, effectively creating a programming mode and a running mode.
In the programming mode the \texttt{74LCX244} is enabled and has control over the affected nets.
In running mode the \texttt{74LCX244} is disabled and the \texttt{ATtiny} is capable of driving the affected nets.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:led_debugging_joint}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:verification_of_requirement_enum:led_debugging_joint}
This requirement states that an LED should be employed for debugging purposes.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
An LED is present on the joint board PCB.


\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirements \ref{enum:design_req1}, \ref{enum:design_req2}, \ref{enum:design_req3}, \ref{enum:design_req4}, \ref{enum:design_req5}, \ref{enum:design_req6}, \ref{enum:design_req7}, \ref{enum:design_req8} and \ref{enum:design_req9}} % (fold)
All of the above requirements concern the design of the pendulum assembly and the joints.
\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
They have all been followed throughout the design of the pendulum assembly.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:overall_joint_power}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:verification_of_requirement_enum:overall_joint_power}
This requirement states that overall power consumption of the design should be minimized.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
In section \ref{par:power_delivery} it was found that the circuit would require $\approx$462mW when transmitting.
In testing it was found that the circuit draws 117mA at 3.7V or 432.9mW.
Since the original numbers were calculated based on maximum values from the datasheets of the components used in the calculation it is reasonable to see a slightly lower number.
\\~\\
The battery chosen for this application has 1600mWH of capacity resulting in a theoretical run-time of $\approx$3:45 hours.
This is clearly not as high as what was desired (10 hours).
The main reason for this is the unexpectedly large power draw of the encoder and the accompanying RS422 decoder.
The DS26LS32CM RS422 decoder draws 52mA at 5V.
The Rolin Encoders are available in versions which output TTL signals meaning that the decoder could be removed. 
Unfortunately, the encoders with this output do not have a unique reference mark and as such it would not be possible to properly calibrate the joint.
