\section{Joint Development}
\label{sec:joint_development}
In creating a pendulum the mounting point must be able to rotate freely about the mounting axis.
To achieve this a joint must be designed which provides this motion.
There are two aspects to the development of the joint: a mechanical aspect and an electronic aspect.
This section will cover the analysis, implementation and verification of both.
