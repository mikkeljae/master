\subsection{Requirement Specification}
\label{sub:requirements}

\mikkel{The following is not finished, but a sketch of the requirements.}
\paragraph{Functional:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item System should consists of double pendulum mounted on a moveable cart.
	\item Cart should be actuated by a motor.
	\item The motor should be controlled by a Microzed.
	\item Position of the cart and joint angles should be measured.
	\item Software on Microzed and joints should be real time.
	\item System should be simple to use
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Safety:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item System should not break when misused.
	\item System safety should not rely on users programming.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Design:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item All parts of the system should be developed using the following method. 
	\begin{itemize}
	 	\item Analysis.
	 	\item Requirement Specification.
	 	\item Design.
	 	\item Implementation.
	 	\item Verification.
	 \end{itemize} 
	 \item System should be designed with learning outcome in mind (not minimizing cost).
	 \item All software should be developed by making an top-analysis initially and hereafter working bottom-up on small parts. 
\end{itemize}
