\subsection{Implementation} % (fold)
\label{sub:controller_implementation}
This section will go through the implementation of the various boards created in relation to the controller board.
The prototyping boards and the experiences gained from them are presented.
Hereafter the manufacturing process of the controller board is shown.

\subsubsection{Prototyping}
\label{sub:controller_board_prototyping}
In order to test important parts of the controller board a home-made prototype PCB was made at the Universitys PCB lab.

Three main functionalities should be verified on the board:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Schmitt-trigger circuitry and \texttt{AND} gate circuit.
	\item PWM logic level shifting.
	\item Motor driver circuit.
\end{itemize}

The remaining functionalities have either been tested previously or were too trivial to test. 
\thomas{comment on the shunt resistor not being tested.}

\paragraph{Schmitt-trigger Circuitry and AND-Gate Circuit}~\\
The Schmitt-triggers were tested by varying the input voltage and verifying the switching threshold along with the the hysteresis levels. 
Testing the \texttt{AND}-gate was done by applying different logic levels and verifying the results.
The complete circuit was found to work as intended and can be seen in appendix \ref{app:controller_board_schem}, at component \texttt{U7} and \texttt{Q14}.

\paragraph{PWM Logic-Level-Shifting}~\\
The functionality of the logic-level-shifter \texttt{74LVC2G17} was verified by measuring input and output on an oscilloscope. 

\paragraph{Motor Driver Circuit}~\\
By measuring the outputs of the inverter \texttt{SN74LVC2G04} it was concluded that there was a design error in the way the component was used and the output signals were invalid.
A thorough investigation of the schematic revealed that the component could be omitted without changing the functionality of the board.
The motor driver circuit on the PCB could not be tested because of this design error.
Therefore it was decided to develop another prototype PCB with the sole purpose of testing the motor driver circuit.
The schematic of the circuit can be seen in \ref{fig:m_drive_circuit_schem} and a picture of the developed PCB in figure \ref{fig:m_drive_circuit}.

	\caption[Prototype PCB with motor driver.]{Picture of PCB developed to test the functionality of the motor drive circuitry.}
	\label{fig:m_drive_circuit}
\end{figure}
The boards gate signals were wired to the gates of four MOSFETs in a full-bridge configuration.
A power resistor was used as a load and PWM signals were applied to the motor driver input pins. 
Measuring the gate signals showed strange behaviour and after a thorough inspection of the board and the schematic it was found that the bootstrap diodes were facing the wrong direction. 
The source of this was an error in the footprint of the component. 
After correcting the issue the driver and the bootstrap circuit was found to function as intended. 
The measured signals are shown in figure \ref{fig:test_hip_signals}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    %\input{graphics/test_motor_drive_signals.tex}
	\caption[Measured gate and input signals.]{Measured low and high side gate signals along with low side motor driver input signals.}
	\label{fig:test_hip_signals}
\end{figure}
It was verified that the low side gate signal follows the waveform of low side input signal, but with a logic level of $\approx$12V as expected. 
It was also verified that the high side gate signals are 180$^\circ$ out of phase of the low side signals and are correctly bootstrapped to $\approx$24V.

\subsubsection{Controller Board} % (fold)
\label{ssub:controller_board}
The controller board was designed by the authors but the PCB was manufactured using an out-of-house PCB fabricator.
Adding components to the top of the board was done using the pick-and-place facilities available at SDU.
A stencil had been ordered along with the design to allow for easy application of solder paste.
\\~\\
As mentioned previously, the bottom side of the board is populated mostly with larger components which are easily handsoldered.
The extra copper on all four layers did, however, complicate the soldering process somewhat.
Applying sufficient heat to the board becomes troublesome, especially with the lower-wattage soldering irons generally available to the authors.
Eventually a heating plate was used to pre-heat the board, which made the process bearable.
\\~\\
A picture of the finished board can be seen in figure \ref{fig:controller_board_img}.
It should be noted that while the authors took measures to avoid errors in the PCB, some amount of them found their way into the design regardless.
Here is a list of the errors that have been found and the fix done to work around them.
Component names are referenced to the controller board schematics found in appendix \ref{app:controller_board_schem}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Missing ground on source of Q22: A wire is soldered from R69 (same net as source of Q22) to ground-side of R73.
	\item \texttt{EM\_MCU} wired to wrong port: The original trace was cut and a wire is soldered from R54 to JX2 Pin14.
	\item Encoder signals not wired to header: Wires are soldered from \texttt{A} at R31, \texttt{B} at R32 and \texttt{Z} at R33 to JX2 Pin32, Pin36 and Pin38.
	\item \texttt{EM\_END} signals not wired to header: Wire soldered from R44 to JX2 Pin30
	\item MOSFETs are reversed in footprint: MOSFETs are reversed in design to negate the reversed footprint.
	Standard TO220 heatsink used.
	\item Footprint of motor capacitors reversed: Capacitors mounted in reverse to negate the reversed footprint.
	\item Inhibit signals of \texttt{PTN78020} and \texttt{PTH08080} connected: Trace cut between the two so that \texttt{PTN78020} is still connected to the net.
	\item \texttt{nRF24L01} module, \texttt{nRFM} (see section \ref{ssubs:nrf24l01}) close to copper: \texttt{nRFM} mounting using wires to clear the copper of the board.

\subsection{Verification} % (fold)
\label{ssub:verifaction_controller_board}
This section will go through the verification of the manufactured controller board.
Verification is split into two parts.
The initial part verifies mainly that the board has been correctly manufactured, while the next part verifies the remaining design of the board. 

\subsubsection{General Verification Procedure} % (fold)
\label{ssub:verification_procedure}
This procedure is created in an effort to allow for an easier debugging procedure of a newly produced controller board, should a developer require the production of a new board.
A blank version appropriate for printing can be found in appendix \ref{sec:controller_board_verification_procedure}.
It should be noted that the version seen below is not identical to the one found in the appendix.
This is because some of the tests performed below are done to verify that the design is done correctly, rather than ensuring that production has been done correctly.
\cmark ~is used to indicate the successful verification of a test while \xmark ~is used to indicate the initial failure of a test.
All pins, components and nets are typeset using the \texttt{teletype font} and are referenced to the schematics in appendix \ref{app:controller_board_schem}.
\paragraph{Verify Voltage Rails} % (fold)
\label{par:verify_voltage_rails}

\begin{itemize}
 	\item Apply 24V to \texttt{24V}.
 	\item Toggle power button to ON.
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item[\cmark] Verify that current draw is within reasonable limits ($<$150 mA).
 			\begin{itemize}
 				\item[-] The current draw was measured to be less than 100mA on average. 
 			\end{itemize}
 		\item[\xmark] Verify 12V, 5V, 3.3V and 2.5V voltage rails.
 			\begin{itemize}
 				\item[-] None of the voltage rails were present.
 				This lead to an investigation of \texttt{PTN78020}, which should produce the 12V rail. 
 				The \texttt{PTN78020}s inhibit pin is insufficiently floating.
 				It has an internal pull-up resistor which should bring the pin voltage up to 1.5V when the signal is left floating externally, but the pin voltage was approximately 0V.
 				Applying a 3V signal to the pin brings the 12V rail up, followed by the 5V and 3.3V rails.
 				The issue was found to be that the inhibit pins of \texttt{PTN78020} and \texttt{PTH08080} are connected to the same net, \texttt{DCDC\_EN}.
 				The \texttt{PTN78020} is not able to correctly raise the voltage on its inhibit pin, because of \texttt{PTH08080}. 
 				Cutting the \texttt{DCDC\_EN} track such that the two are effectively on separate nets fixed the issue.
            	This results in not being able to disable the \texttt{PTH08080} manually, however this will happen in an acceptable manner by simply turning off the \texttt{PTN78020}.

			Investigation showed that the footprint of the four $330 \mu F$ electrolytic capacitors was inversed. 
			Desoldering the capacitors and soldering in the correct orientation yields the expected behaviour and the 24V can be measured at \texttt{POWER\_IN}.
			The charging curve of the capacitors through the inrush current is shown in figure 
			\ref{fig:controllerboardv2_inrushcurrent_charge} and it can be seen that the initial charge of the capacitors takes approximately 1s.

%As explained, the verification procedure is meant as a check list for future developers producing a new PCB.

%his verification is needed to verify the design and it is therefore not important to do it for each PCB, but one time per new design.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:motor_speed_direction}} % (fold)
\label{subs:requirement_enum:motor_speed_direction}
This requirement specifies that motor speed and direction should be adjustable through PWM output ports of the MicroZed.

\paragraph{Test}~\\
Verification of the requirement is done by applying a \texttt{low} level signal to \texttt{DIS} and \texttt{PWM\_B} while applying a 3.3V PWM signal to the \texttt{PWM\_A} pin.
Gate signals should be measured and it should be verified that the motor is turning.
Hereafter the dutycycle should be altered and the motor speed should change.
Repeat for channel \texttt{B}.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
The test was done on both channels and it was verified that direction and speed can be controlled through PWM signals on channel \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}.
The gate signals for channel \texttt{B} are shown in figure \ref{fig:controllerboardv2_gate_b}, where it can be seen that the high side gate signals are correctly bootstrapped.

\paragraph{Addendum}~\\
During further testing of the system the H-bridge suddenly gave up and released its smoke.
This spurred an extensive quest to determine the root cause of the issue.
Eventually the data in figure \ref{fig:current_w_load} was found.
This data suggests that a large current, $>20$A is drawn when \texttt{DIS} is set to \texttt{low} and the output of the motor driver is enabled.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	%\input{graphics/current_w_load.tex}
	\caption[Main power supply current draw, 0\% duty cycle.]{Current draw when setting \texttt{DIS} low and applying a 10\% duty cycle PWM to the high side MOSFET of channel B. Supply current is measured in amperes.}
	\label{fig:current_w_load}
\end{figure}

This current draw continues for approximately 4ms and then disappears.
While the current draw is present the 24V rail falls which, eventually, will cause the 12V rail to fail, causing the 5V rail to fail and, finally, the MicroZed to power down.
At low PWM duty cycle the 24V rail recovers before the failure happens.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	%\input{graphics/current_w_load_closeup.tex}
	\caption[Main power supply current draw, 10\% duty cycle.]{Current draw when setting \texttt{DIS} low and applying a 10\% duty cycle PWM to the high side MOSFET of channel B. Supply current is measured in amperes.}
	\label{fig:current_w_load_closeup}
\end{figure}

By inspecting the data of the time immediately after \texttt{DIS} is set \texttt{low}, as seen in figure \ref{fig:current_w_load_closeup}, it is apparent that the gate signal on the high side MOSFET is never pulled below 12V and as a result the MOSFET is always conducting, creating shoot-through on the 24V rail when the low-side MOSFET is conducting.
Due to this the current can be seen to step up at every pulse of PWM until at approximately 0.2ms where a steady state occurs.
This steady state is maintained until approximately 4ms have passed where suddenly the gate signal does correctly go to 0V, meaning that the high-side MOSFET no longer conducts, allowing the 24V rail to recover.
\\~\\
In an attempt to work around the issue the first 4ms after setting \texttt{DIS} \texttt{low}, were spent with 0\% PWM, yielding the result seen in figure \ref{fig:current_w_load_slow}.
This is the expected behaviour.
PWM starts, slight current increase at the supply, steady 24V rail.
\\~\\
The issue was not detected during the initial testing because the digital circuitry and the H-bridge were powered using seperate power supplies.
This was convenient at the time because it allowed testing parts of the circuit without risking shorting out the H-bridge or otherwise harming the circuit.
Since the 12V and therefore the 5V rail were unaffected by the dipping 24V rail the problem did not cause the MicroZed to power down and the problem was therefore undetected.

	\centering
	%\input{graphics/current_w_load_slow.tex}
	\caption[Main power supply current draw, 0\% duty cycle.]{Current draw when setting \texttt{DIS} low and applying a 0\% duty cycle PWM to the high side MOSFET of channel B for 4ms before applying 10\% PWM. Supply current is measured in amperes.}
	\label{fig:current_w_load_slow}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:motor_current}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requrement_enum:motor_current_}
This requirement specifies that it should be possible to measure the current through the motor using the ADCs on the MicroZed.

\paragraph{Test}~\\
Place a 3 $\Omega$ resistive load across the motor terminals and apply 24V to the board.
Set \texttt{PWMA} to \texttt{LOW} and \texttt{PWMB} to \texttt{HIGH}.
This will create a direct current path through the H-bridge and therefore through the 200$\mu\Omega$ shunt resistor.
The resulting current will be 8A.
This results in a voltage drop of 1.6$\mu$V which should result in a measurable 160mV on the output of the \texttt{INA286}

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
The output was measured and is shown in figure \ref{fig:controllerboardv2_current_sense}.
As can be seen the output is approximately 300mV, twice as large as the expected output, 160mV.
Furthermore the signal is very noisy with spikes as large as 200mV peak-to-peak. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
%\input{graphics/controllerboardv2_current_sense.tex}
\caption{Measured output voltage of current sense amplifier.}
\label{fig:controllerboardv2_current_sense}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Addendum}~\\
The data was gathered with NO switching of the MOSFETs.
Further tests revealed that additional noise is introduced when the MOSFETs are actively switching.
Spikes appeared in the data that do not in any way represent the current flowing through the load.
\\~\\
During design the necessity of an analog ground was overlooked, despite the obvious need for one when handling signals as delicate as are seen here.
Unfortunately it is unlikely that this feature can be used without a redesign of the board.
This redesign would include the addition of an analog ground and possibly an attempt at increasing the signal voltages.
While this would cause more power loss due to the higher resistance to ground it would also make the signals more robust and therefore easier to measure correctly.
\\~\\
Lacking the current measuring feature is unfortunate but only excludes the possibility of current mode control.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:voltage_rails}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:voltage_rails}
This requirement states that five voltage rails should be present on the controller board. 

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
In the verification procedure in section \ref{par:verify_voltage_rails} it is verified that all rails are present.
The voltages of the rails were measured for 20ms and the mean voltage of each rail is shown in table \ref{tab:meas_rails}.
\begin{table}[]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption[Measured mean voltages on the rails.]{Measured mean voltages on the 2.5V, 3.3V, 5V and 12V rails respectively.}
\label{tab:meas_rails}
\end{table}
All measured values are within the values specified in the requirement specification.


\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:voltage_transients}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:voltage_transients}
This requirement states that voltage transients on voltage rails should be minimized.

\paragraph{Test}~\\
The voltage across the H-bridge should be measured while driving the motor in order to detect voltage transients. 

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
While conducting the test as described above it was not possible to detect any voltage transient due to the current draw by the motor.
This is as expected, because of the capacitor bank.
The motor current and the current draw from the main power supply was measured while driving the motor.
The measured waveforms are shown in figure \ref{fig:controllerboardv2_currents}.
Here it can be seen that even though the motor current is alternating the supply current is mostly DC.

	\centering

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:microzed_interface}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:microzed_interface}
According to requirement  \ref{enum:microzed_interface}, the MicroZed should be interfaced correctly. 
This includes start-up and power-down sequences.

\paragraph{Test}~\\

Testing if the board complies with the correct start-up and power-down sequence should be done by measuring the appropriate signals when turning the board \texttt{on} and \texttt{off}.

\paragraph{Conclusion}
All appropriate signals during startup where measured and are plotted in figure \ref{fig:controllerboardv2_startup}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	%\input{graphics/controllerboardv2_startup.tex}
	\caption[Signals measured doing startup of controller board.]{Signals measured doing startup of controller board with the MicroZed inserted. The 3.3V rail does only rise in voltage, when \texttt{VCCIO\_EN} has a higher voltage level than 1.3V.}
	\label{fig:controllerboardv2_startup}
\end{figure}
It should be noted that the \texttt{VCCIO\_EN} signal is controlled by the MicroZed and not the developed controller board. 
It isverified that the voltage on the 3.3V rail does not rise when the voltage of \texttt{VCCIO\_EN} is lower than 1.3V.
This level is the high threshold of the comparator that enables the DCDC converter that generates the 3.3V rail.
Furthermore, using the work done in \cite{isaswarm}, it is verified that the measured signals correspond to the ones produced when powering \texttt{on} the MicroZed using Avnets own MicroZed carrier card.
\\~\\
The appropriate signals when shutting down the controller board and the MicroZed are measured and plotted in figure \ref{fig:controllerboardv2_shutdown}.
It is verified that \texttt{VCCIO\_EN}, \texttt{POWER\_EN} and \texttt{DCDC\_EN} are set to \texttt{GND} in the correct order.

	\label{fig:controllerboardv2_shutdown}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:cool_mosfets}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_ref_enum:cool_mosfets}
Requirement \ref{enum:cool_mosfets} specifies that MOSFETs should be cooled to avoid overheating. 

\paragraph{Test}~\\
The MOSFETs should run the motor for several minutes at a high velocity. 
During the test, the MOSFETs should not get hot.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
During production of the board an error in the footprint of the MOSFETs was found, causing the solution with the large common heatsink to be unachievable.
Therefore individual standard TO-220 heatsinks were connected to each MOSFET.
The motor was driven by the MOSFETs for several minutes with a duty cycle of 95\%, while not getting warm.
It should be noted that this test does not necessarily stress the motor sufficiently to fully conclude sufficient cooling.
Once the system is finished a test should be designed which moves the cart back and  forth repeatedly to have more current flow through the MOSFETs.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:hardware_for_wireless_implemented}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:hardware_for_wireless_implemented}
This requirement specifies that hardware for wireless communication using RF should be implemented on the controller board.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
The \texttt{nRFM} was chosen and placed on the board with an SPI connection to the MicroZed.
\\~\\
Part of the reasoning behind choosing an RF module was the expectation that it would forego the need of an extensive protocol.
The chosen module, the \texttt{nRF24L01}, does however, utilize a rather extensive protocol and transmission of the angular position is 75\% overhead, 25\% payload.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:important_prototype}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:important_prototype}
This requirement specifies that important parts of the circuitry should be tested on prototype PCB.
\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
Two prototype PCBs were created which lead to correction of two errors and verification of the rest of the functionality.
Time and money was saved this way, by correcting the errors before ordering the full board from a professional PCB vendor at a higher cost and a long delivery time.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:pcb_strategy}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:pcb_strategy}
According to this requirement the PCB layout should be reviewed according to the five steps of the developed strategy.
\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
Using this method a PCB layout was produced with significantly less errors than the previous experience of the authors.
The fact that the final PCB contained errors indicates that the steps were not followed thoroughly enough or that the method is flawed.
Two of the errors originated in a difference between a components footprint and the symbol in the schematic.
Therefore it should be added to the footprint inspection step that it should be checked for all components if their footprint is in accordance with the symbol in the schematic.
The conclusion on the rest of the errors was that the steps should have been followed more thoroughly.
\thomas{Try harder is insufficient.}
Especially it would have been beneficial to use the peer-review step more comprehensively.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:pcb_debugging}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:pcb_debugging}
This requirement specifies that the PCB layout should be designed with debugging in mind.
\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
This was done by adding six debugging headers with a total of 55 signals to the PCB design.
The debugging headers were used extensively in the debugging process.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:pcb_layout}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:pcb_layout}
This requirement specifies that the PCB should be designed to accomodate appropriate power levels.
\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
Three trace widths are used, 8 mil for signals, 20 mil for power and 40 mil for high power.
MOSFETs, full-bridge driver and the accompanying components were sized to accomodate 80A, the stall current of the motor.
\\~\\
A power and a digital ground plane was created on the PCB of the controller board.
It was found during debugging that an additional analog ground plane is required to properly utilize the current measurement capabilities designed into the PCB.
The debugging leading to this conclusion can be seen in section \ref{par:verify_shunt_amplifier_functionality}.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:pcb_soldering}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:pcb_soldering}
According to this requirement all PCB soldering should be possible at SDUs facilities.
\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
The PCB soldering was successfully done using SDUs facilities.

\subsubsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:any_trigger_em}} % (fold)
\label{ssub:requirement_enum:any_trigger_em}
This requirement states that any unmet safety conditions should halt the cart.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
Signals from emergency button, endstops and emergency signal from MicroZed are wired to an \texttt{AND}-gate, resulting in one signal that determines if a safety condition is unmet: \texttt{EM\_DIS}.
\\
The power delivery to the H-bridge is delivered by the main relay.
The \texttt{EM\_DIS} signal is used to the control relay effectively cutting the power to the motor when a safety condition is unmet.
