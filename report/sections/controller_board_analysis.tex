\subsection{Analysis}
\label{sub:controller_board_analysis}

In order to develop a controller board capable of controlling a double pendulum, the required functionality of the board needs to be determined. 
This section will constitute an analysis of this functionality and an analysis of possible solutions to desired functionality. 


\subsubsection{Motor Driver}
It is necessary to device some form of driving circuitry for the motor driving the timing belt.
The motor should be able to move in both directions. 
An H-bridge allows this bidirectional movement.
By properly switching the MOSFETs in the bridge the average voltage across the motor can be controlled and therefore also the speed and direction of the motor.
As such, an H-bridge must be designed for the controller board.
\\~\\
An H-bridge of the size likely required here will require a sizeable capacitor bank across the supply near the H-bridge.
This is done to protect the remainder of the PCB against voltage spikes generated by parasitic inductances. 
They also serve to supply any sudden power requirements by the motor.
The necessary amount of supply capacitance must be determined.
\\~\\
When introducing a large amount of capacitance in a circuit, a problem known as inrush arises.
This happens when the circuit is powered on and the initial charging of the capacitors occur.
Due to the amount of capacitance, the circuit will draw a very large current for a significant amount of time which can potentially destroy parts of the circuit.
For this reason it is necessary to design circuitry which will temporarily limit the current through the circuit until the supply capacitors are charged.
Such a circuit is often comprised of a relay in series with a resistor.
The design of the circuitry surrounding the inrush relay must be designed.

\subsubsection{Voltage Rails}
The controller board will have a variety of electronics and there will be a need for different voltage rails as standard digital electronics cannot use the 24V rail that is used to drive the motor.
Each voltage rail needs to be designed to be able to deliver the power required by the components present on that rail.

\subsubsection{Motor Current Sensing}
In order to implement current mode control it is necessary to accurately measure the current being drawn by the motor at any given time.
Current measurements are generally done by either hall effect based sensors or shunt resistors. 
Hall effect based sensors are usually better for high current applications where adding a resistor in series with the load is infeasible. 
Additionally, their interference with the circuit they are measuring is negligible.
Hall effect sensors however, do come at a significantly higher cost.
A shunt resistor used for current measurements is simply a resistor with a very low resistance, typically $<$ 100m$\Omega$, and a high power rating ranging from a few watts into 10's of watts depending on the application.
By adding such a resistor in series with the load, the voltage across the resistor can be measured and from that the current through the load determined.
\thomas{What are the requirements of the accuracy? What can we achieve with the hardware?}


\subsubsection{Safety} % (fold)
\label{subsub:safety}
It is expected that at an error may occur that causes the cart to move uncontrollably.
A safety system should be constructed in such a way that it will prevent the cart from crashing violently.
It should be isolated from the remaining system.
Therefore, if it can at all be avoided, no programming should be involved in determining a safety condition.
With this in mind, the safety system for this platform should be designed in such a way that, when activated, it will cut power to the motors.
In order to more easily identify the cause of the fault, the remaining electronics should remain operational to maintain the current program status.
\\~\\
\mikkel{Endstops should be explained earlier in the report}
Creating the endstops can be done in a multitude of ways.
In this project three approaches were considered:
\paragraph{Mechanical Switch:} % (fold)
\label{par:mechanical_switch}
The simplest form of switch is the mechanical switch.
The switch should be mounted in such a way that the cart would move into the switch, therefore activating it.
This approach is not without issues.
Firstly, the simplest mounting solution would require the switch to be mounted in the direct path of the cart.
If the cart is traveling at full speed it is unlikely that the cart would stop before crashing into the switching mechanism, potentially damaging it.
A switch mounted in this fashion would need to be rather robust.
Some other mounting solutions could be thought of that do not suffer from this problem, especially if a flexible microswitch is used.
These types of switches can be fragile and may not be sufficiently durable, considering the usecase.
All mechanical switches have one drawback in common: they are mechanical.
Generally, mechanical items wear out over time and require maintainance or replacement.
% paragraph mechanical_switch (end)
\paragraph{Hall Effect Sensor:} % (fold)
\label{par:hall_effect_sensor}
This type of sensor measures magnetic fields and produces a voltage proportional to the strength of the field.
By placing a small neodymium magnet on the cart and mounting a hall effect sensor on the rail in such a way that the coincide would allow for detecting when the cart is above the sensor.
If the sensor is combined with a schmitt-trigger circuit the output could be a binary result, either the endstop is reached or it is not.
Using this method requires that a magnet is placed on the cart itself and that a sensor is mounted to the rail.
It should be noted that accelerating rather strong magnetic fields back and forth on the platform may not be the least electrically noisy solution one could think of.
Magnetic fields are also wide, meaning that the cart would "sneak up on" the threshold.
This requires some amount of calibration to determine the correct distance between sensor and magnet, which may not be mechanically simple to determine. 
% paragraph hall_effect_sensor (end)
\paragraph{Infrared Transceiver:} % (fold)
\label{par:infrared_transceiver}
This type of device is a combined LED and infrared sensor.
The LED is optimised for emitting infrared light, or radiation (IR), and the sensor for sensing it.
The LED emits IR outward from the device which, when an object is placed in front of it, will bounce off the object and be caught by the sensor.
As with the hall effect sensor, this type of device produces a voltage output proportional to the amount of IR being sensed and as such a schmitt-trigger circuit would also be benficial in this case.
With this sensor type it is important to realise that the LED will not be the only emitter of IR in the vicinity.
Any type of lamp will emit IR, especially glowbulbs (of which there are few left, luckily) but also sunlight contains some amount of IR.
When using this sensor the circuit should be designed in such a way that only the effect of the IR radiated back on the sensor will trigger the circuit.
The sensor should be mounted immediately below the cart so as to maximize the radiated IR and therefore the signal strength.
% paragraph infrared_transceiver (end)
\\~\\
While all of the above have their drawbacks, it was decided to use the infrared transceiver.
This sensor allows the greatest reliability while being reasonably simple to mount on the platform in that it requires no modification to the cart.
\\~\\
In addition to the endstops, also an emergency button, preferably red, should be able to cut power to the motors.
In order to minimize the amount of circuitry, all safety features will trip the same circuit.

%Removed by Mikkel:
%It is expected that at an error may occur that causes the cart to move uncontrollably.
%In such a situation the programmer should be able to completely shut off power to the motor.
%The endstops will ensure that a minimum of mechanical or electrical damage is incurred on the platform in case of a cart crash.
