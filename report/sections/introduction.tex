\subsection{System Overview} % (fold)
\label{sub:system_overview}
Since the reader is unlikely to have precognition of the report they are about to read and therefore this section is written in an attempt to provide an overview of the terminology used going forward.
Figure \ref{fig:systemoverview} is a depiction of the finished design.
Every arrow points at a crucial part of the design which is referred to repeatedly throughout the report.
When the part is referred to it will be done by that name to limit any potential confusion.

\subsection{System Users} % (fold)
\label{sub:system_users}
As will be elaborated on in future chapters, the system developed in this report is intended as an educational platform to be used in future projects.
It was proposed by the supervisor of the project, Leon Bonde Larsen who also set some of the requirements.
Throughout the report three types of users are referred to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Authors:} Perhaps not surprisingly, this type refers to the authors of this report who, coincidentally, are also the original designers of the system.
	They are expected to have indepth knowledge of every aspect of the system.
	\item \textbf{Developers:} A developer is a person who does work to improve or otherwise alter the functionality of the system.
	They are expected to have knowledge of the interfaces that exist, both in hardware and software.
	Some developers may wish to further improve the electronics or joint design however, for the purposes of this report, a developer is expected to use the hardware as-is.
	\item \textbf{User:} The user is a person who applies control algorithms to the system in an effort to balance the system.
	They are expected to have knowledge of the software interfaces related to motor control, system calibration and joint control.
\end{itemize}
