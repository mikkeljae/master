\subsection{Verification of: Requirements \ref{enum:system_consists_double_pendulum} and \ref{enum:cart_actuated_by_motor}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:system_consists_double_pendulum}
These requirements specify that the system should consists of double pendulum mounted on a moveable cart and that the cart should be actuated by a motor.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
The implemented system consists of the designed and implemented pendulum assembly mounted on the rail system inherited from an earlier project.
A picture of the full system setup is shown in figure \ref{fig:pic_full_system}.
Specific requirements for designing and implementing the pendulum assembly are described and verified in section \ref{sec:joint_development}.

\end{figure}
The cart can be actuated by the maxon motor as they are connected by a belt. 
This was never tested because of burnt electric components and time constraints, however it was tested that the developed controller board is able to drive the motor.



\subsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:controlled_by_microzed}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:controlled_by_microzed}
This requirement states that the pendulum system should be controlled by a Microzed.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\

\subsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:position_cart_joint_angle_measure}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:position_cart_joint_angle_measure}
According to this requirement the position of the cart and joint angles should be measured.

\paragraph{Test?}~\\

\subsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:software_developed_real_time}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:software_developed_real_time}
This requirement specifies that any software developed for the pendulum system should be real-time.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\


\subsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:system_accessible_to_users}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:system_accessible_to_users}
This requirement states that the system should be easily accessible to users.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\


\subsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:system_should_not_break_during_operation}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:system_should_not_break_during_operation}
This requirement specifies that the system should not break during operation by users.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\

\subsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:safety_should_not_rely_on_programming}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:safety_should_not_rely_on_programming}
According to this requirement the system safety should not rely on the programming of the system.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\

\subsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:software_top_down_bottom_up}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:software_top_down_bottom_up}
This requirement states that software design should be done top-down, whereas subcomponents are written bottom-up.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\


\subsection{Verification of: Requirement \ref{enum:design_linux_possible}} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_requirement_enum:design_linux_possible}
This requirement specifies that the system should be done so that adaption to Linux is as simple as possible.

\paragraph{Conclusion}~\\
