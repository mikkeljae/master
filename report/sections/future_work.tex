\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sub:future_work}
As is customary with projects, this one did not fully accomplish what the authors originally intended.
This section will go through some of the work required to correct mistakes done by the authors as well as present some of the features that may be of interest for future developers.

Both the controller board and the joint board, while functional, would benefit from a second iteration to correct these mistakes.
