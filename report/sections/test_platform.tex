\label{sec:the_platform}
A new platform was made available to the project which fulfilled many of the requirements set by the application.
It consists of a cart, driven by a timing belt, mounted on an aluminium rail.
An image of the platform can be seen in figure \ref{fig:platform}.
\mikkel{Maybe mention what it was used for before?}
