-Set 3.7V on VBATT
	3.3V rail functioning.
	Diode layout inversed, flipping diode and lifting centre legs works around the issue.
	Lifting VCC of U7 yields functioning 5V rail.
	During testing the lab supply was current limited to approximately 250mA. This turned out to not be sufficient for U7 to properly boot, yielding what looked like a short circuit in the PCB. 
	After several hours of debugging, fixing a few production errors and resoldering half a board, the current limit was raised and both voltage rails appeared as expected.
	Datasets: joint-board-startup-limit/no-limit, shows current spike necessary.
-Verify voltage stepper functionality
	Test successful
-Verify RS422 Circuit
	Test successful. If P is greater than N, O is high.
-Verify functionality of ATTiny84
	Programming is possible. Intermittent issue during running of the program, this is due to the RESET pin being floating. In order to fix this issue a pull-up resistor should be placed between the 3.3V rail and the RESET pin.
