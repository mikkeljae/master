Procedure:
	-Find mosfet with sufficient current rating (80A).
	-Find full-bridge driver capable of driving the mosfets.
		-Find switch-on time with given gate charge and gate drive current
		-Should have dead-time and shoot-through protection.
		-Output voltage significantly higher than mosfet gate threshold.
	-Calculate bootstrap circuit component parameters.
		-Calculate minimum required capacitance.
			-Choose suitable diode.
		-Find possible values close to but higher than the calculated.
		-Evaluate which capacitance yields the most acceptable transient respons. (Higher values require longer charge times).
		-Calculate value of current limiting resistor, Rboot. (limit should be below diode rated current)
			-Include maximum surge current argument
		-Verify that the calculated values are still legitimate after adding the voltage drop across the resistor.
	-Find relay capable of switching the power rail (80A)
		-Has to be actively closed (breaks on power loss).
		-Design driving circuit

	To do: 

	- Determine gate resistor size
	- Determine supply capacitor size
	- Determine inrush current circuit (could be mosfet and resistor parellel to relay)
