Procedure:
	-24V on 2P connector
	-Emergency button connected and activated
	-DIS set high

	Everything is cold and acts as expected

	-DIS set low

	Everything is cold and acts as expected

	-Full setup, motor not connected.

	Functions as expected with DIS set high. Attempted with and without emergency state.

	-Set DIS low

	Short circuit between PWRIN and PGND.

	-Retry with no voltage

	Channel B high and low are shorted, resulting in identical drive signal. (Short existed between R36 and R37)
	Attempting on channel A revealed very long charge/discharge for gate signals: data: tek00000 and tek00001.

Day two...
	-Relays off by setting emergency situation, M_RELAY low, INRUSH low, no voltage across bridge.

	Turning on PWM did not cause sparks, smoke or other unfortunate instances. 
	Gate signals on channel b: tek00004, tek00005 and tek00006, tek00007

	-Removing emergency situation, set M_RELAY high, INRUSH high, voltage across bridge

	No sparking: data: tek00008, tek00009

	Data for switching with 16 ohm load (parellel diode): tek00010 gate low, tek00011 source high, tek00012 gate high
	Data for switching with 16 ohm load (parellel diode): tek00013 gate low, tek00014 source high, tek00015 gate high


	Data for switching with 16 ohm load (no diode): tek00017 gate low, tek00018 source high, tek00019 gate high
	Mosfet got hot and we did not want to test more...

	Data for switching with 16 ohm load (diode, 5 ohm resistor): tek00020 gate low, tek00021 source high, tek00022 gate high
