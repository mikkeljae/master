            The INHIBIT pin of the PTN78020 is apparently not sufficiently floating. Applying a 3v signal to the pin brings the 12V rail up, followed by the 5 and 3.3V rails.
            Voltages in data: voltage-rails
            The PTN78020 has internal pullup to 1.5V while the PTH08080 has internal pullup to 3V on the inhibit pin. This resulted in a conflict since they were connected to the same net (DCDC_EN). Cutting the DCDC_EN track such that the two are effectively on seperate nets fixed the issue.
            This results in not being able to disable the PTH08080 manually, however this will happen in an acceptable manner by simply turning off the PTN78020.
    -Verify MicroZed Startup Sequence
        Voltage rail startup data: voltage-rail-startup
        MicroZed startup sequence. This is to be tested properly once the MicroZed can be mounted on the PCB since it supplies the VCCIO_EN signal.

-Safety Circuitry
    -Simulate no emergency
        -Q14 dead, EM_ENDx_OUT signals not tested, set high manually.
        -Set EM_MCU low
        -Set EM_BTN High
            Above combination yields EM_DIS High. Changing state of either signal yields EM_DIS Low.
            Test successful.
-Relay Circuitry
    -Inrush Relay
        -Make EM_DIS High
        -Set INRUSH Low
            PWRIN is low, as expected.
        -Set INRUSH High
            Footprint of Main CAP (C16-C19) is inversed. Desoldering caps and resoldering one in the correct orientation yields the expected behaviour from inrush relay.

        -Verify R46 thermal performance
            Cool!
    -Main Relay
        -Make EM_DIS High
        -Set M_RELAY High
            24V rail present on Main Caps

-Motor Driver
    -Set DIS High
    -Apply PWM to Buffer (U3)
        3.3V at input is correctly converted to 5V at output. Toggling DIS enables/disables gate output of HIP4081. Proper MOSFET configuration is required to verify bootstrapping.
